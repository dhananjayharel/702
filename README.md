# movie-finder
This is a simple application I've developed in React JS that allows a user to search the [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). A user simply types in the name of a movie and the API returns the closest match. A user can then view basic information about the film such as the duration, the genre, a plot overview and its IMDB rating.

The site is available to view at https://moviefinder.tomsymonds.co.uk.
